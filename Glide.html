                        <p class="lead">One day over a regular phone conversation, my brother told me the sad story of how he missed a guest
                            lecture by MIT Professor and great astrophysicist Walter Lewin. He is an aspiring astrophysicist, 
                            so I could understand his frustration when he missed the lecture. This made me
                            wonder how did he miss it? And how many more students like him are missing out on important events in
                            the universities? <br><br>
                            Could it entirely be the fault of ignorant students? Or was it also because of lack in communication?

                            Not only do these activities contribute immensely to the quailty of their school life but equip students with
                            so much more like better social skills, reduced stress levels, improved concentration and positive mental

                            Those who practice time management behaviors are more clear about their role and perceive that they
                            perform better, said a <a href= "https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ea72/13c01261e9e172f1c362be3781df30f6f5b7.pdf">

                                        • Senior students were better informed, as they were part of student bodies and thus had better network
                                        with other students.<br>
                                        • Word of mouth played a bigger role in getting the word around the campus than notice boards. So
                                        outgoing students missed less.<br>
                                        • Year 1 students missed the most events because of their limited peer network. Also year 1 students
                                        had most events as compared to other student like try-outs for student bodies,

                                        generic notices. They are disorderly and no attention is paid to make it visible to its targeted students. Students
                                        can not be held accountable for not being able to retrieve relevant information out of many paper

                                        <p class="headinglead">Why e-mails did not work?</p>
                                        Inboxes are often cluttered with unnecessary spam. On a slim chance when its not, e-mails are often read
                                        in a haste and if an e-mail isn’t course related, chances of dismissal is higher, students usually pay less
                                        attention to it. Even if some students paid attention, there has to be additional steps taken to complete the
                                        process. After finding a event of interest a student must make a calendar entry to get a timely reminder or
                                        write it on a piece of paper and place somewhere its visible so as to not forget about it.</p>

                                <h1 class="h2 mnt-8">First Sketches</h1>
                                <p class="lead">After first few sketches it occurred to me that not just events but class schedule is equally important for
                                        a university student. The class schedule changes every semester! This was a no-brainer and I quickly
                                        integrated this idea, of having class schedule, in the designs because of the reasons -<br>
                                        1. Students typically used phone calendars or printed schedules. Having class schedule alongside event
                                        schedule really completed the picture for them. Inturn for the business, this meant students not going
                                        to other apps for schedule, resulting in more retention.<br>
                                        2. Students now really got a complete overview of their daily engagements in one place. Like never before,
                                        they are presented with a platform where they can thoughtfully organize their work and play much
                                        efficiently.<br>
                                        Two major categories of Glide now were– Events and Schedule.<br>

                                        day which are Lecture, Labs, Events (if any added) and self created Tasks. All these different engagements
                                        are denoted by different colors for easier scanability. Reminders can be set for one or all tasks as
                                        desired.

                                        them, eg: event for year 1 football trials will not be shown to year 4 students.<br>
                                        Students can add desired events to their schedule to plan their days. They can also Favorite a student
                                        body of their choice and choose to get fututre event notifications from them.
